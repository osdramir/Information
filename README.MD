Hello! I am a graduate student researcher in the [Psychology Department](https://www.psychology.msstate.edu/) at [Mississippi State University](https://www.msstate.edu/). I work for [Dr. Julia Soares](https://www.psychology.msstate.edu/directory/jsoares) in the Everyday Memory Lab. I am interested in learning and memory, and how these processes are affected by the use of external tools such as notes, computers, and the internet.

## Peer-Reviewed Research

* [**Turn Off, Tune Out? Testing the Effects of Webcam Use on Learning in Synchronous Online Classrooms**](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/504170d6e4b0b97fe5a59760/t/67090bdc7968744e4dcd99fd/1728646109090/Perez+-+2024+-+Turn+Off%2C+Tune+Out+Testing+the+Effects+of+Webcam+Use.pdf)

    > Synchronous online classes have grown in popularity, sparking debate on student webcam use. In Experiment 1, participants were assigned to attend a lecture with half instructed to turn their webcam on and half instructed to turn their webcam off (interpolated testing was also examined as a buffer against webcam effects). A webcam effect was observed: webcam-on participants outperformed webcam-off participants. Experiment 2 manipulated class-wide webcam use by creating uniform groups in which participants all had webcams on or off at the same time and mixed groups in which webcam use was evenly split. The webcam effect replicated in the mixed condition, but the effect was attenuated in the uniform condition, suggesting that the webcam effect is larger in mixed webcam classes. Additional findings suggest that feelings of accountability and reduced media multitasking for webcam-on participants could contribute to the webcam effect more than social presence.

## Other Research

* [Investigating the pretesting effect under cognitive load through increased playback speed](https://scholarsjunction.msstate.edu/td/6162/)

    > Abstract Pretesting prior to a study session has been shown to benefit memory for pretested information compared to traditional study. While previous research has not found a detriment to non-pretested but related material, it is possible that taxing attention by increasing the playback speed of presented material could reveal such impairments. The current study (N = 239) compared multiple-choice learning from educational videos at 1x, 1.5x, and 2x speeds. Three videos (one at each speed) were presented after a pretest, for which half of the tested material was pretested, and half was not (non-pretested related). Another three videos were presented without a pretest(non-pretested). Benefits from pretesting and impairments associated with increased playback speed were observed, but no evidence of impairments to non-pretested related information were observed even at an increased playback speed. These results are inconsistent with an attentional account of the pretesting effect.
